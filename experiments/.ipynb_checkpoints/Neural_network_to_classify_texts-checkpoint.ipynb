      "        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\n",

      "option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\n",

      "        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\n",

      "station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\n",
      "reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\n",

      "        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\n",

      "Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n",
      "\n",
      "        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\n",
